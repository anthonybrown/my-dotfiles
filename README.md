# My-Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles that I've made through trial and error.

I've used pre-made ones like [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) and others.
But didn't like those, so I came up with my own.

I use the ZSH shell by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and
created my own theme for that.

I'm also using a host of plugins that you'll find in my .vimrc file.
Take what you like and mix and match, whatever works for you.

I take no responsibility for your machine if you use my dot files, you should
know what you're doing before playing with your dotfiles, but hey, that's how you
learn, by doing. So go for it and learn something.

Cheers!
